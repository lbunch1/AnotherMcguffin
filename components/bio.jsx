The band formed in 2020 from long time friends and musicians with a common interest to make dynamic, engaging music. Drawing inspiration from bands like The Foo Fighters, and The Strokes, they also have a distinct mix of early alternative influence reminiscent of Fastball. Their unique style of music, and energy will captivate and enthrall audiences of all ages and styles.
